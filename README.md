# Portfolio 2024

This site is a quick portfolio put together at the start of 2024.

Over 3 days, numerous distractions such as: 

- going to the shops to replace shoes that my child had somehow grown out of in 2 months
- Baking Sourdough bread 
- getting the kids back into school once the holidays had finished and attending numerous meetings at school to introduce teachers and expectations

I was able to put this together.
